DATA 221 Assignment 1, By Aden Nguyen
-------------------------------------------
(Note: For some of these questions, I wasn't too sure what exactly they were asking for, so I went with what made the most sense.)

Quick Descriptions of each question/file:
- Question 1:
  This question asks to create a program that multiplied consecutive integers (starting from one) until a certain threshold is exceeded, which then prints out the final product, and the multiplier that produced the final product.
  
- Question 2:
  For this question, it asks to define a function that creates a nested dictionary where the keys are strings from a given list, and the values are the inner dictionaries that stored the length of the string they are assigned to, and if the length was even or odd (parity). That nested dictionary then gets printed out.

- Question 3:
  Given a nested list of integers in pairs, this question asks to define a function that calculates each pair from the list as an exponent of the other, while skipping all the pairs where the exponent is negative. All of the results are then put inside a new list, and get printed out.
    
- Question 4:
  Making use of the random library, this question asks to find all the indices of a randomly generated list of values between 0 and 1, that are greater than or equal to a random value "x". It then asks to print out the sorted list of random values, the value of "x", and the first matching index if it exist. (I wasn't too sure if the question wanted the index of the first value that is equal to "x", or the first value that is greater than or equal to "x", so I just printed both.)
  
- Question 5:
  This question asks to define a function that calculated the areas of two circles with given radii from the user, and the percentage of how much the smaller circle covers the larger circle's area, which is then printed out. The question also requires you to handle invalid inputs with meaningful messages. (I wrote two functions for this question, so it would be more organized)

- Question 6:
  Simliar to the last question, question 6 asks to define a function that for each value in a given list, finds the percentage of all the elements that are less than or equal to that value, compared to the total number of elements in that list. Each unique value is then put as a key in a dictionary, with their assigned value being their percentage.
  
- Question 7:
  For Question 7, it asks to write a function that gets an input from the user for the number of seconds it's been since midnight, then converts the seconds into what the actual time would be relative to midnight, which is then printed out as a formatted string. This question also requires you to handle invalid inputs with meaningful messages. (I wasn't sure if the output needed to be just the hours, minutes, seconds, and whether if it was AM or PM all printed out separately, or if it needed to be like how a clock would work. So I just wrote it like how a clock would work, because that made more sense to me. I also wrote two functions for this question.)

- Question 8:
  This question makes use of the pandas library, and asks to create a DataFrame from a given dictionary. The question then asks to make a new column that is derived from the existing columns, and to print the final DataFrame.
