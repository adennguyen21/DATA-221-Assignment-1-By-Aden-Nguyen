DATA 221 Assignment 1, By Aden Nguyen
-------------------------------------------
(Note: For some of these questions, I wasn't too sure what exactly they were asking for, so I went with what made the most sense.)

Quick Descriptions of each question/file:
- Question 1:
  This question asks to create a program that multiplied consecutive integers (starting from one) until a certain threshold is exceeded, which then prints out the final product, and the multiplier that produced the final product.
  
- Question 2:
  For this question, it asks to define a function that creates a nested dictionary where the keys are strings from a given list, and the values are the inner dictionaries that stored the length of the string they are assigned to, and if the length was even or odd (parity). That nested dictionary then gets printed out.

- Question 3:
  Given a nested list of integers in pairs, this question asks to define a function that calculates each pair from the list as an exponent of the other, while skipping all the pairs where the exponent is negative. All of the results are then put inside a new list, and get printed out.
    
- Question 4:
  Making use of the random library, this question asks to find all the indices of a randomly generated list of values between 0 and 1, that are greater than or equal to a random value "x". It then asks to print out the sorted list of random values, the value of "x", and the first matching index if it exist. (I wasn't too sure if the question wanted the index of the first value that is equal to "x", or the first value that is greater than or equal to "x", so I just put both.)
  
- Question 5:
  This question asks to define a function that calculated the areas of two circles with given radii from the user, and the percentage of how much the smaller circle covers the larger circle's area, which is then printed out. The question also requires you to handle invalid inputs with meaningful messages.
